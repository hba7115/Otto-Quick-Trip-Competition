## Troubleshooting Guide
### Common Issues
1. **Gyroscope not responding**: Check I2C connections (SDA/SCL)
2. **Servo jitter**: Verify power supply voltage (should be ~6V)
3. **Walking instability**: Check servo calibration and trim values
4. **Code upload fails**: Verify Arduino board selection and COM port

### Debug Tools
- **Serial Monitor**: Real-time sensor and servo data
- **Serial Plotter**: Visual representation of gyroscope readings
- **Multimeter**: Voltage and continuity checking
