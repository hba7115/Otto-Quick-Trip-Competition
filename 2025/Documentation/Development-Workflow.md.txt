### Software Finalization  
- [ ] **Final code version tagged** in GitHub
- [ ] **Competition code uploaded** and tested
- [ ] **Backup code saved** on USB drive
- [ ] **Serial monitor output verified** - clean debugging
- [ ] **Emergency code ready** - simplified backup version

### Documentation Complete
- [ ] **All test results documented** and committed
- [ ] **Hardware configuration finalized**
- [ ] **Photos uploaded** to Google Drive
- [ ] **Strategy document reviewed** and updated
- [ ] **Contact information** for team/support

## Competition Day Morning (2 Hours Before)

### Setup and Calibration
- [ ] **Arrive early** for setup and testing
- [ ] **Fresh batteries installed** - verify voltage
- [ ] **Competition surface testing** - brief functionality check
- [ ] **Gyroscope calibration** on competition floor
- [ ] **Step length verification** on competition surface

### Final Preparations
- [ ] **Code upload confirmed** - latest version loaded
- [ ] **Serial monitor tested** - output visible and clear
- [ ] **Physical inspection** - no loose parts or damage
- [ ] **Backup plan ready** - secondary code if needed
- [ ] **Documentation organized** - have key info accessible

## Competition Execution (30 Minutes Before Run)

### Pre-Run Protocol
- [ ] **Final calibration** - gyroscope zeroed on competition surface
- [ ] **Battery check** - sufficient power for full run
- [ ] **Position verification** - Otto properly aligned at start
- [ ] **Serial monitor ready** - laptop connected and logging
- [ ] **Camera ready** - photo/video documentation prepared

### Competition Run
- [ ] **Otto positioned** at starting line
- [ ] **Reset pressed** to begin autonomous run
- [ ] **Monitor progress** (no intervention allowed)
- [ ] **Document performance** - note any issues observed
- [ ] **Record final position** - distance and deviation

### Post-Run Activities
- [ ] **Measure results** with judges
- [ ] **Save serial monitor data** 
- [ ] **Take photos** of final position
- [ ] **Note any issues** for documentation
- [ ] **Thank judges and volunteers**

## Post-Competition Documentation

### Immediate (Same Day)
- [ ] **Record official results** - distance and accuracy
- [ ] **Document performance** vs expectations
- [ ] **Note competition conditions** - floor, environment
- [ ] **Photo upload** to Google Drive
- [ ] **Initial lessons learned** notes

### Follow-up (Within 1 Week)  
- [ ] **Complete competition report** in Test-Results-2025.md
- [ ] **Update GitHub repository** with final results
- [ ] **Share results** with DPRG community if appropriate
- [ ] **Plan improvements** for 2026 competition
- [ ] **Backup all data** - complete project archive

## Emergency Procedures

### Hardware Failure
- **Servo issues**: Use backup servo calibration values
- **Power problems**: Fresh batteries, check connections
- **Sensor failure**: Switch to dead-reckoning backup code
- **Physical damage**: Withdraw if unsafe to continue

### Software Issues
- **Upload failure**: Use backup laptop/USB cable
- **Calibration problems**: Use pre-determined offset values
- **Serial errors**: Switch to minimal debug version
- **Unexpected behavior**: Reset and retry once

### Competition Rules
- **Clarify rules** with judges before run
- **Understand scoring** methodology
- **Know restart policies** if allowed
- **Respect time limits** and other competitors

## Success Metrics

### Minimum Acceptable Performance
- **Complete the course** without major failures
- **Achieve 100-140 inches** distance (within 20" of target)
- **Maintain general direction** (not wildly off-course)

### Good Performance
- **110-130 inches** distance (within 10" of target)  
- **Less than ±15 inches** deviation from straight line
- **Smooth, confident operation**

### Excellent Performance
- **115-125 inches** distance (within 5" of target)
- **Less than ±8 inches** deviation from straight line
- **Minimal corrections needed during run**
